# Brave Sync Code Workaround

In 2022, Brave Browser added a new word to all new and existing sync chains.

If you had been relying on Brave Sync as a way to backup your browsing data - *which I have now learned is unsupported* - you may have been surprised if you reinstalled Brave and attempted to re-sync your data.

When I typed in my 24 word code I was met with the error:<br>
**"This code was generated by a deprecated version of Brave, please upgrade your other device first"**

Without access to an active device on my sync chain, I became worried when I learned that the 25th word is re-generated daily.

Fortunately, I then learned that the word is [systemically chosen](https://community.brave.com/t/recovery-key-not-accepted-on-fresh-install-had-to-start-from-scratch/418838/12) from a list based on the number of days between the current day and May 10th, 2022.

This script uses Python to generate the daily word and displays it below.

To get syncing again, try adding today's code to your 24 word sync chain. If this doesn't work, try using tomorrow's code.

### Today's Code
<b id="todayCode">Generating today's code...</b>

### Tomorrow's Code
<b id="tomorrowCode">Generating tomorrow's code...</b>

This works as of 6/26/2023, but it might not work in the future. It is a tool provided for your convenience.
